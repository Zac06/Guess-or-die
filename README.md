# Guess or DIE

This game, build around my own SDL2 abstraction layer (SDL_base), is a guessing game (take for example the show \"Who wants to be a millionaire?\"), that gives you some... penalties, you could say.

WARNING: **SAVE YOUR WORK** before launching the game. Penalties are mild, but annoying if you're working on something important. Have fun!
